It’s not my fault that I can’t understand your pain
I’m going round in circles over nothing
Despite the energy I’ve spent on being you
I don’t think it’ll all amount to something

So please forgive me if I’m seeming far away
It takes a while to find the hard reset key
My body’s broken, and my psyche’s doing worse
At this point, it’d be best if you could end me

I want to fall apart again
With water in my veins
And ice inside my brain
Oh, I need to crash against the day
A slave to all I make
A teardrop in the lake

I call

It’s been a week since I’ve had a proper meal
And yet my brain still seems content to let me starve
The months just flicker by; I can’t yet bring myself
To cry for the ragged holes they carve
So I apologize for my selfishness
The ways I’ve left you powerless as I retreated back into myself
I’ve been a weight on you; I haven’t paid my dues
You know I don’t deserve your help

At the end of the universe
There is nothing but the embers of your soul
Listen close to your death drive; there is nothing left in this life
And the gods will know you chose right, but I can see the light

I want to fall in love again
With lightning in my veins
A storm inside my brain
Oh, I need to claw above the day
To care for all I make
To hear the echoed wake

I call

When the night is gone
The tides will part
All a testament to fear of moving on
I won’t let you have this one
Not until my collapsing heart turns to rust
